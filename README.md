##### About Hacker News

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

##### Objectives

The project aims to answer the following questions from the data:

1. Which post ('Ask HN' or 'Show HN' posts) receives more comments on average?
2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

##### Data

The data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). It has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not  receive any comments and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.
